# Crypto Tracker - A Personal Project to learn API calls

This app tracks the values of Bitcoin, Ethereum and Litecoin by default using the Crypto Compare API.
This can be changed by just modifying the URL in the model.dart file.
I still use the Scoped Model as I feel its pretty straight forward and I feel it is simple compared to the Provider.

To use this please add your Crypto Compare API Key in the model.dart

* I still need to find a way to compare the previous values and modify color accordingly.
