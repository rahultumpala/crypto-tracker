# Crypto Tracker - A Personal Project to learn API calls

This app tracks the values of Bitcoin, Ethereum and Litecoin by default using the Crypto Compare API.
* This can be changed by just modifying the URL in the model.dart file.
* I still use the Scoped Model as I feel its pretty straight forward and simple compared to the Provider architecture.

To use this please add your Crypto Compare API Key in the model.dart file in lib folder

Then build the app using Flutter.
